# Coding Style Guide

To maintain consistency and readability across our projects, please adhere to the following coding standards:

## General Principles

- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand.
- **Consistency**: Follow the established patterns and conventions in the codebase.
- **Documentation**: Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic or decisions.

## Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: Use descriptive names in `camelCase`.
- **Functions**: Use descriptive names in `camelCase`. Function names should typically be verbs.
- **Classes**: Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.

## Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters.
- **Braces**: Use braces for all control structures, even if they are not required.
- **Spacing**: Use a single space after commas and around operators.

## Language-Specific Guidelines

*Adapt the following sections to the programming languages used in your projects.*

### JavaScript

- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons.
- **Quotes**: Use single quotes for strings.
- **Arrow Functions**: Prefer arrow functions for anonymous functions.

### Python

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- **Quotes**: Use single quotes for strings, but be consistent.
- **Type Annotations**: Use type hints where appropriate.

## Commenting

- **Function Documentation**: Use docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of functions.
- **Inline Comments**: Use sparingly to explain complex or non-obvious code.

## Version Control

- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

By following this style guide, we ensure that our code remains clean, consistent, and maintainable. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding these guidelines, please feel free to discuss them with the team.
